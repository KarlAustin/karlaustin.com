## Err... Sorry?

When I wrote Part 1 of this I siad I'd post updates and well, I didn't, so sorry about that.

## How it's going

It isn't, I pretty much gave up trying to use my iPad as a laptop replacement, but at the same time I didn't need a 'laptop' either.

## What I did

Ultimately my Mid 2015 MBP had to be retired from business use as it wouldn't go past macOS 13 and the security software we use needs at least 14 these days.

### Enter Ubuntu

About 3 months ago though I decided that I might as well put Linux on it, so installed Ubuntu 24.04 which was a breeze and absolutely flies along.

It's not perfect, sometimes it'll crash things, which I believe is down to the graphics as the MBP makes use of both the integrated Intel graphics and discrete AMD and switching between them can cause issues in 24.04 based on some quick googling.  That said, most of what I use it for is done in a terminal window so not stressing the graphics anyway.

#### Security

Fortunately the software that caused the MBP's retirement runs on Linux just fine.

## Still not much use

It still isn't getting a lot of use, but I know I can do what I need to when I want to, especially given a good percentage of my day sat at either of my desktops is spent inside Ubuntu via WSL2.

## What about the iPad?

It sits in my bag, it's weight dragged at me, begging to be used. It gets used as a glorified e-reader and for occasionally and quickly dealing with Sharepoint.
