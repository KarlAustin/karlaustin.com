## It's Not Easy
It turns out it isn't as easy to take a decent self portrait as you'd think.  Due to a number of factors I scrapped plans for my photo session today, but as it turned out I could actually do it but had no models, so the only one left was me.

One of the reasons I take photos is so that I'm not in them, I don't like having my photo taken and even though no one else was present it still took me some time to get even slightly comfortable being the subject of my photos.

### Stay Still Man!
Getting yourself in the right position & pose each time you make a change is pretty much impossible, especially if you've manually focused the camera as I did to start with.  Manual focus + long focal length + non-repeatable positioning = out of focus photos.

Even though I was shooting with my camera connected to my laptop it was still tricky trying to balance, pose & lighting.  I don't shoot using the live view mode, as I've never been happy with the results.  You really can't beat the real-time feedback you get from looking through the viewfinder and seeing the effect the modelling lights have.

I did consider taking a bigger screen with me, but it was even more kit to load and unload so in the end I decided not to - I really should have taken it and also put some contact lenses in!

## Not a Wasted Experience
Even though I had no one else modelling for me, it wasn't a wasted session.  I still learnt a few lessons, which is what it's all about right now, one of them being to have some spare modelling bulbs to hand!

More importantly then that though, I learnt that I really do need to get off my backside and join the gym, enough is enough.  I've put on about 12Kg (nearly 2 stone) since we got married at the end of 2012, it's time that it went.
