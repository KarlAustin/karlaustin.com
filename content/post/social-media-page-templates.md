If you've ever had to maintain a couple of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. pages you'll know what a pain it can be when they keep changing how things look and the sizes you need for your header and profile images.

In updating a set of profiles for Ilumia Images yesterday I had that very same issue.  Fortunately a quick search of Google brought me to the resources page of {{< url-link "Every Interaction" "http://www.everyinteraction.com/resources/" >}}, a web design business based in London.  The page has PSD templates for:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
* Google+
* Youtube

So you can just drop your images in, make sure they're the right size and that everything looks good.

Now there's no excuse for not getting those profile pages looking good.
