The simple fact is that pretty much every useful tool now relies on Kuberenetes, it&amp;rsquo;s such a large ecosystem that everyone supports it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at lots of simpler alternatives, some of which I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to use but they usually fall into one or all of:
Poor documentation - making it hard to get going Won&amp;rsquo;t integrate with other tools we (want to) use Small community of public users - meaning if we need to find an answer to something we&amp;rsquo;re stuck or it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Enterprise Support&amp;rsquo; empty the wallet time Current Stack As you&amp;rsquo;d expect, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a current stack that it would be good to play nice with, which means our OpenNebula + Storpool platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
