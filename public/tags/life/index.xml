      <description>We Don&amp;rsquo;t Negotiate With Terrorists or Threenagers Now don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, we really can&amp;rsquo;t complain with George, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many tantrums at all. I&amp;rsquo;d like to lay claim to that being down to me, but in reality it&amp;rsquo;s Karen and her DNA. Today however was one of those, &amp;ldquo;How can I be so heartless?&amp;rdquo; moments, as today there was no negotiation, it really was &amp;ldquo;Our way or our way&amp;rdquo;.</description>
