      <description>What a PITA I&amp;rsquo;m the technical admin of the Whitwell Community Centre Facebook page. Every now and then someone will create a new Facebook Location for the centre and when we spot them, we merge them in to the main page, pretty standard stuff.
Don&amp;rsquo;t make it easy will you? Facebook don&amp;rsquo;t make it easy, this time it has been a right pain. I tried to merge the location in with the official page, unfortunately the official page wasn&amp;rsquo;t listed int he drop down of pages I could merge it with.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to maintain a couple of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. pages you&amp;rsquo;ll know what a pain it can be when they keep changing how things look and the sizes you need for your header and profile images.
In updating a set of profiles for Ilumia Images yesterday I had that very same issue. Fortunately a quick search of Google brought me to the resources page of Every Interaction , a web design business based in London.</description>
