      <description>The Honeymoon Is Over Let&amp;rsquo;s get this out of the way now. I like Wordpress, I like how quick it is to get a site up and running and how easy it is to add functionality to a site. It&amp;rsquo;s going though.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Wordpress since around version 1.5, as have many of our customers at KDA. Whilst Wordpress is supposed to make things easier, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really. It just swaps some things you need to do, for another set of things you need to do instead.</description>
