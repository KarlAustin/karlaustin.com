      <description>The Problem When you connect to an internet peering exchange, the IP addresses you&amp;rsquo;re given for your interfaces will most likely have been used by someone else prior to you, that has left the exchange.
This means, because we&amp;rsquo;re not all good at housekeeping, that you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with ISPs trying to open up BGP sessions with your routers and if you&amp;rsquo;re not firewalling them out then you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a lot of messages about BGP Opens being received from unconfigured neighbours.</description>
