      <description>5Ghz Here We Come A few months ago I changed my home router from a Mikrotik RB2011 router to a Linksys WRT1900ACSv2 - Not a particularly cheap router, it&amp;rsquo;s still &amp;pound; even now. I changed because I wanted 5Ghz wireless as the 2.4Ghz around here is massively congested, plus I wanted some faster speeds for copying photos to my NAS. I&amp;rsquo;ve got Gigabit wired to most rooms, but I just can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to find a cable most of the time to hook up to - I don&amp;rsquo;t usually have one long enough at home, work tends to stay at work these days.</description>
