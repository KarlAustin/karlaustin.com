When I wrote Part 1 of this I siad I&amp;rsquo;d post updates and well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t, so sorry about that.
How it&amp;rsquo;s going It isn&amp;rsquo;t, I pretty much gave up trying to use my iPad as a laptop replacement, but at the same time I didn&amp;rsquo;t need a &amp;rsquo;laptop&amp;rsquo; either.
What I did Ultimately my Mid 2015 MBP had to be retired from business use as it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go past macOS 13 and the security software we use needs at least 14 these days.</description></item><item><title>From laptop to iPad - Part 1</title><link>https://karlaustin.com/posts/from-laptop-to-ipad/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karlaustin.com/posts/from-laptop-to-ipad/</guid><description>Background For a few years I used my laptop for everything, it travelled from work to home and back again, it was my only machine at home and at work. At work it got hooked up to three external monitors via dock, at home I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother.
Eventually all that changed and I needed more power in the office and at home, so it was back to a desktop at each location and my laptop become for travel only.</description></item></channel></rss>
