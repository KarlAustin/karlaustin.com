&lt;h1 id=&#34;5ghz-here-we-come&#34;&gt;5Ghz Here We Come&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I changed my home router from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00I4QFQDI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00I4QFQDI&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=karlaustincom-21&#34;&gt;Mikrotik RB2011&lt;/a&gt; router to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01562PSIU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01562PSIU&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=karlaustincom-21&#34;&gt;Linksys WRT1900ACSv2&lt;/a&gt; - Not a particularly cheap router, it&amp;rsquo;s still &amp;pound; even now.  I changed because I wanted 5Ghz wireless as the 2.4Ghz around here is massively congested, plus I wanted some faster speeds for copying photos to my NAS.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got Gigabit wired to most rooms, but I just can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to find a cable most of the time to hook up to - I don&amp;rsquo;t usually have one long enough at home, work tends to stay at work these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-hard-can-it-be-to-get-ipv6-working&#34;&gt;How Hard Can It Be To Get IPv6 Working?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the Linksys interface, so I did what any self respecting IT geek does, I put DD-WRT firmware on it straight away, which it turns out was a mistake.  It has very poor support for IPv6 out of the box, as in virtually non-existent if you just want to put a few details in to the interface and have it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours of googling and faffing I&amp;rsquo;d had enough and went back to the stock Linksys firmware to see what the IPv6 support in that was like, after all it does claim to support IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;liar-liar-pants-on-fire&#34;&gt;Liar Liar, Pants On Fire&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst it&amp;rsquo;s true that the WRT1900ACSv2 does support IPv6, it&amp;rsquo;s a bodge.  The only thing it supports is 6rd, which is tunneling mechanism and not native IPv6.  Tunneling is a bodge at the end of the day and high end routers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just be limiting you to a bodge, they should have proper native IPv6 dual-stack support.  There&amp;rsquo;s no excuse these days. None.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;openwrt-come-on-down&#34;&gt;OpenWRT, Come On Down&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes ranting at Linksys I switched over to OpenWRT, what a revelation compared to DD-WRT.  The web interface, Luci, was virtually instant with anything asked of it and had proper IPv6 support built right in there; that&amp;rsquo;s not to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t have problems though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on an FTTC connection from &lt;a href=&#34;http://goscomb.net&#34;&gt;Goscomb&lt;/a&gt; and for v6 I have a /48 subnet assigned to me - unfortunately this doesn&amp;rsquo;t get pushed to the router by Router Advertisement (RA) or DHCPv6, only the /64 linknet.  Getting the /48 on to the router wasn&amp;rsquo;t an issue, a quick bit of googling gave me the simple and Ubuntu style config file format for the network, within 10 minutes of flashing the router I&amp;rsquo;d got IPv6 addresses out to the clients.  That&amp;rsquo;s when the fun began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;no-ipv6-connectivity&#34;&gt;No IPv6 Connectivity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the clients had got an IPv6 address, they couldn&amp;rsquo;t actually get to anything out on the net.  That&amp;rsquo;s when a couple of hours of fiddling around started, I could either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have IPv6 addresses on the clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the router connect out via IPv6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but not both.  After a while I did get both happening, but still no IPv6 from clients to the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out the default route that was being configured to send IPv6 from the router, to the other end (Goscomb) of the Link-Local v6 subnet wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually doing it&amp;rsquo;s job and I had to manually configure an IPv6 default route to just aim all v6 traffic at the wan interface.  A very simple thing to do, but one that still took too long to find and work out late at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;this-is-my-day-job-it-shouldn-t-be-this-hard&#34;&gt;This Is My Day Job - It Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Be This Hard!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind this is my day job and I work with routers that are insanely complex compared to your average home router and cost well in to 5 figures at the low end, it just shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this difficult.  I get that most people use a router from their ISP so that all of this is hidden from them, bt there are still an awful lot of people who don&amp;rsquo;t because their ISP doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide one, or the one it does provide is awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 2017, IPv6 was drafted in 1996, it&amp;rsquo;s 21 years old.  In that time it&amp;rsquo;s been tweaked a bit along the way, but there&amp;rsquo;s really no excuse for any home router to not have it, other than saving a few pence on a bill of materials and that&amp;rsquo;s just irresponsible to their users and the internet as a whole.  Without widespread IPv6 adoption for end users we end up with nasty solutions such as CG-NAT, when NAT should have been put out of its misery years ago, not adding more layers of complexity to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Peertools: Automated notification of unsolicited BGP Open requests at peering points</title>
      <link>https://karlaustin.com/post/peertools-automating-notification-of-potential-peers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 18:41:30 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you connect to an internet peering exchange, the IP addresses you&amp;rsquo;re given for your interfaces will most likely have been used by someone else prior to you, that has left the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means, because we&amp;rsquo;re not all good at housekeeping, that you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with ISPs trying to open up BGP sessions with your routers and if you&amp;rsquo;re not firewalling them out then you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a lot of messages about BGP Opens being received from unconfigured neighbours.  If you&amp;rsquo;re firewalling (and you should be) and you&amp;rsquo;re logging you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a lot of hits logged against port 179.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally you&amp;rsquo;d like everyone to keep their peering neat and tidy, but we&amp;rsquo;re not in an ideal world unfortunately.  So I came up with a tool that will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan your message log for BGP opens from unconfigured neighbours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan your message log for TCP with unexpected MD5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan your firewall log for connections to port 179 that have been dropped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This catches most instances and you end up with a list of IP address, the system then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looks at the peering point data to see what ASN the IP address is assigned to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks PeeringDB for a peering contact for the ASN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emails the peering contact based on the email template, which by default shows the peering LAN and IP addresses trying to open sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-it-supports-right-now&#34;&gt;What It Supports Right Now&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JunOS 12.x - It may work with other versions of JunOS, but that&amp;rsquo;s what it has been tested with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH - Key based SSH for connecting to JunOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINX - Currently it is hard coded to work with LINX, The London Internet Exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PeeringDB - Only PeeringDB is supported at the moment for fetching an AS numbers peering contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email - Email is the current form of contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-it-can-support-right-now-if-you-want-to-write-a-module&#34;&gt;What It Can Support Right Now If You Want To Write a Module?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The router code is modularised and self contained, so any router or switch can be supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The router class includes what commands to execute to fetch and parse the data in to an IP address.  Additional commands are added in to an array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-future&#34;&gt;The Future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to make a simple suite of tools for small ISPs without their own staff to better manage their peering relationships.  The next evolution will hopefully add tracking support, so it will log when you last emailed a given peer and allow you to set a time period for them to respond before it emails again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;where-can-i-find-it&#34;&gt;Where Can I Find It?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/KarlAustin/peertools&#34;&gt;https://github.com/KarlAustin/peertools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is currently still a little rough in places, as it was quickly built to deal with the 30 or so IPs hitting our peering routers every few seconds.  So far we&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple of ISPs stop and several agree to peer with us.  Please feel to contribute or comment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>cPanel - Broken FTPS (FTP over TLS) with Java Clients</title>
      <link>https://karlaustin.com/post/cpanel-ftp-tls-and-the-java-devil/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://karlaustin.com/post/cpanel-ftp-tls-and-the-java-devil/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve gone to edit your site and suddenly found that your chosen IDE won&amp;rsquo;t connect to upload any more via FTPS (FTP using TLS encryption) and your web host runs cPanel, then chances are they&amp;rsquo;re running v56 and your IDE is written in Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit this issue with another website late last week, where the DH params had already been re-generated to 2048 bit, but that change removed.  Your IDE probably just says it can&amp;rsquo;t connect, that&amp;rsquo;s what JetBrains WebStorm and PhpStorm do although the logs did give more information:
&lt;pre&gt;
Caused by: java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException:
Prime size must be multiple of 64, and can only range from 512 to 2048 (inclusive)
&lt;/pre&gt;
NetBeans gave the game away sooner by giving the error from Java about DH parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weak-dh-keys&#34;&gt;Weak DH Keys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root cause of the issue is a problem with weak Diffie-Hellman key sizes, widely reported as the Logjam attack.  The recommendation is to move to 2048 bit prime number sizes which sounds brilliant, but then&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;damn-you-java&#34;&gt;Damn you Java&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only Java 8 supports 2048bit DH params, v7 supports a maximum of 1024bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big problem is that Java 8 supports only a &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; of 2048bit, this is where we hit an issue with cPanel v56.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;oops-cpanel&#34;&gt;Oops cPanel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that on April 20th 2016 cPanel pushed out an update that generated new dhparams for pure-ftpd, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand the warnings around Java, as they generated 3072 bit DH params, which you can verify with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
openssl dh -in /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd-dhparams.pem -text -noout
&lt;/pre&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll see output like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
Diffie-Hellman-Parameters: (3072 bit)
    prime:
        00:80:26:5e:fe:c9:8e:63:2d:6d:52:3e:ab:4c:49:
        &lt;snip&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
As you can see, 3072 bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixing-it&#34;&gt;Fixing it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the fix is easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
cp /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd-dhparams.pem /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd-dhparams.pem.bak
openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/private/pure-ftpd-dhparams.pem 2048
service pure-ftpd restart
&lt;/pre&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ve backed up the existing params just in case and generated new ones for pure-ftpd to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;will-it-break-again&#34;&gt;Will it break again?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That remains to be seen.  The issue has been reported to cPanel, so hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t break as we&amp;rsquo;re not just talking a few IDEs here like JetBrains, NetBeans etc. there are also countless ERP systems out there that use Java and a lot of them shuffle files (such as orders, tracking info for shipping) in and out via FTP with their customers and suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Claiming a Facebook Page - Nightmare!</title>
      <link>https://karlaustin.com/post/facebook-claiming-a-page/</link>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-a-pita&#34;&gt;What a PITA&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m the technical admin of the 

    
        
    

    &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.whitwellcommunitycentre.com&#34; target=&#39;_blank&#39;&gt;Whitwell Community Centre&lt;/a&gt;

 Facebook page.  Every now and then someone will create a new Facebook Location for the centre and when we spot them, we merge them in to the main page, pretty standard stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;don-t-make-it-easy-will-you&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t make it easy will you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook don&amp;rsquo;t make it easy, this time it has been a right pain.  I tried to merge the location in with the official page, unfortunately the official page wasn&amp;rsquo;t listed int he drop down of pages I could merge it with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just try and claim it as the owner, part of that is adding an email address from the organisation to your profile.  Easy enough right? &lt;em&gt;Oh no&lt;/em&gt;, my email address is in the form of &lt;code&gt;admin@&lt;/code&gt; which Facebook promptly told me isn&amp;rsquo;t a valid email address - which is funny, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting email at it for several years now.  So off I pop to configure a different email address, which Facebook then willingly accepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking that this might have changed the merge outcome I have another go, &lt;em&gt;nope&lt;/em&gt;, still not listed in the drop down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook do say that the pages need to have similar names (they have exactly the same name) and be of the same type.  Now trying to work out how to get the official page to say just &amp;ldquo;Community Centre&amp;rdquo; is what was fun, it took 30 minutes of experimenting to work that one out, trying different combinations of types and sub-categories. Why I can&amp;rsquo;t just type in &amp;ldquo;Community Centre&amp;rdquo; and it suggest the appropriate options I will never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;arghhhhh&#34;&gt;Arghhhhh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have everything matching, the name, the type of organisation and yet it &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; won&amp;rsquo;t list the official page in the drop down for me to merge it with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How a company with so many developers and experts in their field can make such a user hostile system I will never know. It should not be this difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;final-hope&#34;&gt;Final Hope&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final hope is that having added an organisation email address and submitted a claim for admin rights on the page, that I will be able to merge it in with the official page.  &lt;em&gt;Fingers crossed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
